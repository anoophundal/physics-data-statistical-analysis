# Exploratory Statistical Analysis of Synthetic Experimental Event Data

This project performs exploratory statistical analysis on a synthetic
physics-style dataset, treating each row as an experimental event.
The analysis focuses on understanding data distributions, correlations,
normality, and outlier behavior using standard statistical techniques.

The dataset is synthetically generated and the project is intended as an
educational exercise in scientific computing and data analysis.
No novel physics claims are made.
